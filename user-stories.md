User Stories:
As a Developer, I want to use object oriented programming to organize all of my data.
As a Marketer, I want a page that cleanly displays three random clickable pictures at one time.
As a User, I want to it to be clear that I'm supposed to click on the pictures before anything changes.
As a Developer, I want to be sure that the pictures that are displayed are random and that nothing repeats in any group of three.
As a Marketer, I want to keep the user intrigued with new options each time they click a picture.
As a User, I want the experience to be easy and painless.
As a Developer, I want to tally the number of times a picture has been shown and out of that number, the percentage of times the picture was clicked.
As a Marketer, I want to keep track of the items the user is most interested in, determined by the number of times each item is clicked on.
As a Marketer, I don't want any results to be shown to users until they've clicked a total number of 25 times.
As a Marketer, I want the page to look appealing to the user, but not so much that it takes away from the pictures.
As a Developer, I want to keep the color of the pictures more vibrant than the background and text color of the page.
